# Image Classification using Neural Networks

In this project, I have designed and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images. For the dataset, I have used the popular CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32 Ã— 32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes are mutually exclusive. 

In the NeuralNetworkSelf.ipynb, I implemented the neural network from scratch in Python including the forward propagation, and back propagation using Numpy. 

In the NeuralNetworkPytorch.ipynb, I implemented the neural network using the Pytorch library (v1.12.1) and used GPUs on Google Colab for faster training times. I also experimented with various hyperparameters like loss function, optimizer, learning rate, batch size, etc.
